# Bulma UI Explorations

A simple explorations of what you can do with Bulma. In this project, we go full speed by building a complete static admin dashboard with login form UI. All done using bulma and css class only.

No need for fancy Chakra UI, Material UI, or any other CSS frameworks. Just use a simple class from bulma backed by the powerful css flexbox
